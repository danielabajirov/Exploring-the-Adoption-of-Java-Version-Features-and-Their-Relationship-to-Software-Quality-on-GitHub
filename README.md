# Project Overview

This repository contains various scripts and datasets used for our research project. The objective of this research is to gather, process, and analyze data to answer specific research questions related to Java development.

## Directory Structure

- **JavaClassParsing**: Contains scripts and data related to the processing of Java classes using the `javaparser` library.
- **MappingProcess**: (Description needed)
- **OracleDocumentation**: Scripts and data for scraping relevant information about methods and their versions from Oracle's Java documentation.
- **Project Domains**: (Description needed)
- **SonarQubeAnalysis**: Contains scripts and datasets for analyzing Java code quality using the SonarQube API.
- **StudyObjectSampling**: (Description needed)
- **Survey**: Contains the survey conducted with Java developers about the adoption of Java versions in the industry.

## Methodology

Our research methodology consists of five main steps:

1. **GitHub data mining**: Leveraging the GitHub API to mine relevant repositories for subsequent analysis.
2. **Oracle documentation data scraping**: Using the BeautifulSoup library to gather important data about methods and their versions from Oracle's Java documentation.
3. **Java class processing**: Utilizing the `javaparser` library to extract details about Java class structure, dependencies, and methods.
4. **SonarQube analysis**: Using the SonarQube API to classify and filter Java rules and evaluate Java code quality.
5. **Survey**: Conducting a survey with Java developers to gather insights on the adoption of Java versions and associated features in the industry.
